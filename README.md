### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Craig Ewert, a programmer from Erie, CO (near Denver and Boulder).

I am currently (aside from sleeping -- can never have enough of that) trying
to recapture the fun of programming from my youth, when all I had was BASIC and
a frame buffer (no GL, no GPU, no nothin), but somehow it felt freer.

And, I am finishing my unfinished learning from back in those days.  There is
a parsing algorithm I once implemented but never understood well enough.  I will
keep implementing it until I do.
